// NOTE: I used the BlockingBuildInterface interface because
//       it looks like your schema changes are NOT backwards compatible with the previous version.
//       You should double-check this yourself though. If they are backwards compatible, use OnlineBuildInterface instead.

// NOTE: I have added the SkipPostBuildInterface interface because
//       it looks like you do not have any changes that require PostBuild to run.
//       You should double-check this yourself though. Remove the SkipPostBuildInterface interface if necessary.

// Please remove these NOTE comments after you have checked the code.
