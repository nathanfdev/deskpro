# If you are using windows please ensure you use the #

# version. This prevents a command line window being #
# generated everytime PHP is run.                    #

# Please note that it must be the CLI version of PHP #
# and not, for example, a cgi-fcgi binary. You can   #
# determine the PHP type by typing /path/to/php -v   #
# on the command line and looking for the string     #
# such as the one below. The cli part is required    #
